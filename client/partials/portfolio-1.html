        <p class="p-h">I worked with two of my bootcamp classmates to recreate classic Asteroids on iOS with a twist.
            Your ship's movement is controlled with motion controls, giving the game an addictive learning curve. We developed
            the game in 3 days for a SpriteKit hackathon and received 1st place. Before the hackathon, we had zero knowledge of
            SpriteKit and Core Motion. Our hackathon build featured a boss and an endless world, but were later scrapped for
            future plans. Currently, LSRIS is transitioning to the Unity game engine with plans of becoming a cooperative
            multiplayer dogfighting game.</p>
